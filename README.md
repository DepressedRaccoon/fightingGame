# fightingGame
 Welcome to a basic fighting game! In this game you are able to move players using WASD and the Arrow Keys. Pressing spacebar allows Player 1 to attack and pressing Arrow Down allows Player 2 to attack. A character wins when either the timer runs out and they have the most health remaining or when a players health is reduced to 0 hit points. 

 ## Things to Add
 - Ground logic: Allows the game to detect when a player has touched the ground. 
 - Jump counter: Players should only be able to jump twice before returning to the ground. 
 - Air attack counter: Players should only be able to attack twice in the air before returning to the ground. 
 - Parry logic: A player should be able to press `q` or `rightShift` to parry an incoming attack. Parrying an attack negates damage. 
 - Fast fall: Players should be able to use the `S` or `ArrowDown` keys to fall faster. Replacement key for Player 2 attacks is needed. 
- Knockback logic: Players can only perform up to two attacks before being shunted away from their opponent.
